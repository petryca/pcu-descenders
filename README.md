### Weeks 2 to 8: Web Design Fundamentals and Tutorials (7 classes)

The topics covered in Weeks 2 to 8 will not follow a strict sequential order. Instead, they will be taught through a series of tutorials and exercises that take a holistic approach, integrating multiple aspects of web design simultaneously. This means that concepts such as design, typography, layout, and interactivity will often be interwoven within each session to provide a more comprehensive learning experience. Due to this approach, it is essential for students to attend all classes, as each session builds on the previous ones and missing a class could impact understanding of the integrated content.
